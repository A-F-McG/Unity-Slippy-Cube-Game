# Personal project: Unity game called 'Slippy Cube' (later renamed 'Cube World')

This files contain the source code for a game written in C# using Unity. The game is a simple get-to-the-exit-while-collecting-as-many-coins-as-possible-and-avoiding-enemies game and can be played here on my website: https://amcgregorprogrammer.wixsite.com/website/cube-world
